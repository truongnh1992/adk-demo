        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Agents & Tools:** The fundamental building blocks for defining capabilities and reasoning. Clear instructions and docstrings are paramount.\n",
        "*   **Runners & Session Services:** The engine and memory management system that orchestrate agent execution and maintain conversational context.\n",
        "*   **Delegation:** Designing multi-agent teams allows for specialization, modularity, and better management of complex tasks. Agent `description` is key for auto-flow.\n",
        "*   **Session State (`ToolContext`, `output_key`):** Essential for creating context-aware, personalized, and multi-turn conversational agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Where to Go Next?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Your Weather Bot team is a great starting point. Here are some ideas to further explore ADK and enhance your application:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Real Weather API:** Replace the `mock_weather_db` in your `get_weather` tool with a call to a real weather API (like OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI).\n",
        "2.  **More Complex State:** Store more user preferences (e.g., preferred location, notification settings) or conversation summaries in the session state.\n",
        "3.  **Refine Delegation:** Experiment with different root agent instructions or sub-agent descriptions to fine-tune the delegation logic. Could you add a \"forecast\" agent?\n",
        "4.  **Advanced Callbacks:**\n",
        "    *   Use `after_model_callback` to potentially reformat or sanitize the LLM's response *after* it's generated.\n",
        "    *   Use `after_tool_callback` to process or log the results returned by a tool.\n",
        "    *   Implement `before_agent_callback` or `after_agent_callback` for agent-level entry/exit logic.\n",
        "5.  **Error Handling:** Improve how the agent handles tool errors or unexpected API responses. Maybe add retry logic within a tool.\n",
        "6.  **Persistent Session Storage:** Explore alternatives to `InMemorySessionService` for storing session state persistently (e.g., using databases like Firestore or Cloud SQL – requires custom implementation or future ADK integrations).\n",
        "7.  **Streaming UI:** Integrate your agent team with a web framework (like FastAPI, as shown in the ADK Streaming Quickstart) to create a real-time chat interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Agent Development Kit provides a robust foundation for building sophisticated LLM-powered applications. By mastering the concepts covered in this tutorial – tools, state, delegation, and callbacks – you are well-equipped to tackle increasingly complex agentic systems.\n",
        "\n",
